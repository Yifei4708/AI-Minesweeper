# AI-Minesweeper
In this programming assignment, you will be tasked with implementing a
Minesweeper AI Agent, which should be able to play and solve the Minesweeper game.
You will have the choice of programming in C++ or Python. Much of the code has
already been written for you. Your agent should be able to take in percepts and act
accordingly. Your grade will depend on your agent’s performance measure. At the end
of the quarter, your agent will compete against your peers’ agents in a class-wide
tournament.
