# AI-Minesweeper
Developed an advanced AI algorithm for solving the Minesweeper game, utilizing Python, Pygame, and NumPy to optimize decision-making through heuristic techniques and data structures. A two-dimensional array was employed to manage game board states, while a visualization tool built with Pygame facilitated debugging and performance monitoring. Logical rules and advanced data structures, such as backtracking and constraint satisfaction problem techniques, were integrated to handle diverse game scenarios, enabling intelligent performance on larger game boards under uncertainty.
